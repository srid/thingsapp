thingsapp
=========

CulturedCode's Things is a Mac-only product. I don't want to carry the macbook
to home, and want my Things tasks accessible from anywhere. Therefore I want
this project to provide me, at minimum, a tool to dump Things tasks to Dropbox
and, at best, run a web application that will allow me to manipulate Things
from anywhere.

It is far from being done, though.
